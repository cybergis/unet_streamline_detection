    "\n",
    "Surface water is an irreplaceable strategic resource for human survival and social development. Accurate delineation of hydrologic streamlines, which represent one of the major forms of land surface water, is critically important for various scientific disciplines, such as water resources assessment, climate modelling, agricultural suitability, river dynamics, wetland inventory, watershed analysis, surface water surveying and management, flood mapping, and environmental monitoring. Traditional hydrological models depend largely on topographic information, which inevitably contain errors. For example, when deriving drainage lines from elevation, dry drainage channels are likely to be falsely recognized as streamlines, and roads or bridges can act as barriers forcing flowlines along the roadway rather than under the bridge or through a culvert. Traditional methods also generally ignore the information about the complex 3D environment of stream channels as well as surface reflectance, which is potentially very useful for accurately delineating streamlines. In recent years, the availability of high accuracy LiDAR data provides a promising method to capture both the 3D environment structure and the land surface reflectance information. Terrestrial LiDAR sensors use NIR light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure range (variable distances) to a surface and reflectance intensity for multiple returns. These light pulses generate precise, three-dimensional information about the shape and characteristics of reflecting surfaces. In this research, multiple LiDAR features maps are generated, and we developed a deep learning model based on the U-Net architecture and attention mechanism for streamline detection. We also compared the deep learning model with several traditional machine learning methods as baseline. An advanced cyberinfrastructure is used for computing power and CyberGIS-Jupyter is applied for research reproducibility. An accuracy evaluation indicates the attention U-net model outperforms the best baseline method by 8.08% on average by F1-score, and it provides better smoothness and connectivity over the predicted streamlines.\n"
